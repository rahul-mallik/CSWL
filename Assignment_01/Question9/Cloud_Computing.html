        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is adopted by every company, whether it is a MNC or a startup and many are still migrating towards it because of the cost-cutting, lesser maintenance, and the increased capacity of the data with the help of servers maintained by the cloud providers. One more reason for this drastic change from the On-premises servers of the companies to the Cloud providers is the ‘Pay as you go’ service provided by them i.e., you only have to pay for the service which you are using. The disadvantage On-premises server holds is that if the server is not in use the company still has to pay for it.</p>
