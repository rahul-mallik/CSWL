        <h1>Digital Logics</h1>
        <p>Digital Logic or Boolean Logic represents signals and sequences in a digital circuit through numbers. It is a system of rules that allow us to make complicated decisions based on simple yes/no questions. It becomes the foundation of digital computing and explains how circuits and hardware communicate within a computer. Digital logic is the basis of computing and many other electronic devices as well as control systems found in this continually advancing digital world. It constructs the implementation of computer operations by manipulating the binary values through printed circuit board technology that uses circuits and logic gates. Most electronic devices, including calculators, computers, video games, and watches, contain this feature. Knowledge in digital logic can be an advantage for many people who work with computers and technology like engineers and technicians.</p>
